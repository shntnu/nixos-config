## 2025-01-21: System vs User Level Management

**Key Insight:** Ubuntu needs different commands than NixOS/macOS because it lacks system-level rebuild tools.

Three management approaches exist:
- NixOS: `nixos-rebuild` manages entire Linux system (kernel, services, packages)
- macOS: `darwin-rebuild` manages macOS system settings and packages
- Ubuntu: Home Manager standalone manages user environment only

Commands differ by platform:
```bash
# NixOS/macOS - system-level
nix run .#build-switch

# Ubuntu/WSL - user-level only
nix run 'home-manager/master' -- switch --flake '.#shsingh'
```

Ubuntu gets CLI tools and dotfiles but not GUI apps or system services. Those need `apt install`.

## Entry Guidelines

Keep entries brief. Structure each as:
- Date and descriptive title
- **Key Insight:** One sentence capturing the core learning
- 2-4 sentences of essential context
- Optional: Relevant command or code snippet
- Optional: Link to docs for deeper dive

Focus on "what" and "why", not detailed "how". Reader can consult docs for implementation details.
